        </h2>
        <p>
            <ul>  My name is Chad Ward and I am currently a teacher.  My current job as 
                a computer science teacher has lead me to explore all aspects of computer
                science, including web development.  My background is varied; including studies in 
                radio communications, history, and electronics engineering, as well as work experience
                with the military and as a technician for the cable industry.  
            </ul>
            <ul>
                This experience lead me to the classroom where I looked to bring real world 
                relavance to my classes.  When I was placed in the computer science classroom, my
                main goal was to demonstrate all the options that computer science has for my
                middle school students.  One of the first things I did was to ditch the traditional 
                "computer" classes and expand the class to truly offer an emmersive experience for my 
                students.  Not only do my students get basic foundational skills, they explore coding with
                a variety of items and develop the growth mindset.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Teaching my class has sparked my developer mindset, which lead me to persue studies in 
                web development.  Through a coding bootcamp offered by Vanderbilt University, I have 
                learned the skills necessary to start a career in Full Stack Development, as well
                as increase my knowledge base for the students I currently serve.  
            </ul>

                First challenge that required clean up for accessibility purposes.  Given a predesigned site, students were asked to 
                reformat the HTML and CSS for readability and to refractor the code.  This challenge also required the students to ensure 
                a live site was set up.  The refracted code and changes for the site can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/chwd31/Module-1-Challenge">repo</a> on GitHub.

            <p>
                This site was designed by a cohort of students to tackle the issue of finding bike sharing locations in a new city.  
                As avid cyclists who travel, we designed as site that can assist the users to finding a bike sharing company in 
                the new city they have traveled to.  The site is also designed to give them the weather in their new location, allowing
                for the user to be fully prepared when they arrive at the destination.  Finally our application offered an FAQ section 
                for the user to get some cycling tips at their new destination. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The site was designed to pull from two separate APIs to retrieve relevant data for the user.  
                While the weather sharing API used was fully functional, the bike sharing API had some limitations
                on data for all cities with bike sharing available.  A future iteration fo the site will include
                using an updated bike sharing API to offer the user more options when traveling.  More Information
                can be found by navigating to the <a href="https://github.com/chwd31/Ride-or-Die-Cycling-App">Read Me</a>
