            About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            <ul>  My name is Chad Ward and I am currently a teacher.  My current job as 
                a computer science teacher has lead me to explore all aspects of computer
                science, including web development.  My background is varied; including studies in 
                radio communications, history, and electronics engineering, as well as work experience
                with the military and as a technician for the cable industry.  
            </ul>
            <ul>
                This experience lead me to the classroom where I looked to bring real world 
                relavance to my classes.  When I was placed in the computer science classroom, my
                main goal was to demonstrate all the options that computer science has for my
                middle school students.  One of the first things I did was to ditch the traditional 
                "computer" classes and expand the class to truly offer an emmersive experience for my 
                students.  Not only do my students get basic foundational skills, they explore coding with
                a variety of items and develop the growth mindset.
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Teaching my class has sparked my developer mindset, which lead me to persue studies in 
                web development.  Through a coding bootcamp offered by Vanderbilt University, I have 
                learned the skills necessary to start a career in Full Stack Development, as well
                as increase my knowledge base for the students I currently serve.  
            </ul>
